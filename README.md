# Doom 64 Weapons for Doom 2
What it says on the tin: Doom 64 weapons remade for Doom 2
## Installation
Grab the pk3 file from the Releases and drag 'n' drop on your source port! I built this mod with GZDoom and while I did my best to avoid ZDoom/GZDoom proprietary functions and such, I haven't tested that it works on other ports, so your mileage with them may vary.
## Building
Just zip the source code and change the file extension from `.zip` to `.pk3` and drag 'n' drop!
